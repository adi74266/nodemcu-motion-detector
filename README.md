# NodeMCU Motion Detector
## Introduction
This is a circuit based project where the motion is sensed and shown on an LED. <br>
In this project there are these components involved:
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- PIR Motion Sensor (HC-SR501)
- Photoresistor (Light Dependent Resistor or LDR)
- I2C OLED Display (0.96", SSD1306) 
- Light Emitting Diode (LED)
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- Micro USB Cable

## Component Details
### ESP8266 NodeMCU
This component is the main processor for this device. It is a 30-pin board which has several GPIO pins, few 3.3 volt VCC pins and few GND pins.<br>
